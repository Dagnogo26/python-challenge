The goal of the project is to use the knowledge learned concerning list, csvreader, for loops , def functions and If statements to analyze PyBank and elections data.
We will manipulate the given data to provide profit/losses changes, maximum increase in profit and minimum decrease in losses as well as retrieving their months for PyBank. Concerning the election data, we will be computing total votes, the votes attributed to each candidate to see who is the winner.
